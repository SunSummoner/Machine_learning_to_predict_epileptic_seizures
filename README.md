# Machine_learning_to_predict_epileptic_seizures
This repository focuses on using machine learning models namely Linear Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect seizure in epileptic patients using the readings from electroencephalogram, or EEG, a device used by hospitals to detect whether the patient is suffering from epileptic seizures or not. Since, it requires highly skilled medical professionals to analyze the reading on electroencephalogram, or EEG and get the correct diagnosis, the seizures often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. Using machine learning, to detect the seizure can help in the detection as well as an earlier diagnose of epileptic seizures.
